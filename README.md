# ClassicPlates
Lightweight nameplates that replicate the classic pre-legion look and feel,
whilst staying compatible with most/if not all other addons that
interface with the default blizzard nameplates.

## Features
* Everything the original nameplates offered.
* Nothing else.


## Feedback
If there's a bug you found, I missed something, or didn't implement a feature
as closely as possible to the original, Don't hesitate to scream at me about it!


## Thanks
* Many thanks to [Townlong Yak][1] for everything they provide.
* Burntbread for testing pre-release versions.
* Anyone who decides to use my addon.
